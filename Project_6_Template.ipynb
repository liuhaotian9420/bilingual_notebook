Specifically, you will use replication data from \\href{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1409483}{Who Matches? Propensity Scores and Bias in the Causal Eﬀects of Education on Participation} by former Berkeley PhD students John Henderson and Sara Chatfield. Their paper is itself a replication study of \\href{https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1017/s0022381608080651}{Reconsidering the Effects of Education on Political Participation} by Cindy Kam and Carl Palmer. In their original 2008 study, Kam and Palmer argue that college education has no effect on later political participation, and use the propensity score matching to show that pre-college political activity drives selection into college and later political participation. Henderson and Chatfield in their 2011 paper argue that the use of the propensity score matching in this context is inappropriate because of the bias that arises from small changes in the choice of variables used to model the propensity score. They use \\href{http://sekhon.berkeley.edu/papers/GenMatch.pdf}{genetic matching} (at that point a new method), which uses an approach similar to optimal matching to optimize Mahalanobis distance weights. Even with genetic matching, they find that balance remains elusive however, thus leaving open the question of whether education causes political participation.              \n              \nYou will use these data and debates to investigate the benefits and pitfalls associated with matching methods. Replication code for these papers is available online, but as you'll see, a lot has changed in the last decade or so of data science! Throughout the assignment, use tools we introduced in lab from the \\href{https://www.tidyverse.org/}{tidyverse} and the \\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MatchIt/MatchIt.pdf}{MatchIt} packages. Specifically, try to use dplyr, tidyr, purrr, stringr, and ggplot instead of base R functions. While there are other matching software libraries available, MatchIt tends to be the most up to date and allows for consistent syntax.              \n              \n# Data              \n              \nThe data is drawn from the \\href{https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/4023/datadocumentation#}{Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Study} which asked students and parents a variety of questions about their political participation. This survey was conducted in several waves. The first wave was in 1965 and established the baseline pre-treatment covariates. The treatment is whether the student attended college between 1965 and 1973 (the time when the next survey wave was administered). The outcome is an index that calculates the number of political activities the student engaged in after 1965. Specifically, the key variables in this study are:              \n              \n\\begin{itemize}              \n    \\item \\textbf{college}: Treatment of whether the student attended college or not. 1 if the student attended college between 1965 and 1973, 0 otherwise.              \n    \\item \\textbf{ppnscal}: Outcome variable measuring the number of political activities the student participated in. Additive combination of whether the student voted in 1972 or 1980 (student\\_vote), attended a campaign rally or meeting (student\\_meeting), wore a campaign button (student\\_button), donated money to a campaign (student\\_money), communicated with an elected official (student\\_communicate), attended a demonstration or protest (student\\_demonstrate), was involved with a local community event (student\\_community), or some other political participation (student\\_other)              \n\\end{itemize}              \n              \nOtherwise, we also have covariates measured for survey responses to various questions about political attitudes. We have covariates measured for the students in the baseline year, covariates for their parents in the baseline year, and covariates from follow-up surveys. \\textbf{Be careful here}. In general, post-treatment covariates will be clear from the name (i.e. student\\_1973Married indicates whether the student was married in the 1973 survey). Be mindful that the baseline covariates were all measured in 1965, the treatment occurred between 1965 and 1973, and the outcomes are from 1973 and beyond. We will distribute the Appendix from Henderson and Chatfield that describes the covariates they used, but please reach out with any questions if you have questions about what a particular variable means."},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"545BC1940F7F481FB6DC0CB726927BAE","jupyter":{},"collapsed":false,"scrolled":false,"tags":[],"slideshow":{"slide_type":"slide"},"notebookId":"64192380bcd20b0330eb4e97","trusted":true},"source":"#

To demonstrate this, they simulate 800,000 different propensity score models by choosing different permutations of covariates.

You may also wish to store the entire models in a list and extract the relevant attributes as necessary.              \n    \\item Plot all of the ATTs against all of the balanced covariate proportions. You may randomly sample or use other techniques like transparency if you run into overplotting problems.
